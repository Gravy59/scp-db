description: An overview of the SCP Foundation's research departments
---

The Foundation's mission is to Secure, Contain, and Protect the anomalous.
However, this is a pretty vast goal, ranging from containing small, harmless
cowbells to universal concepts endangering the very core of humanity. The entire
Foundation cannot tackle all these anomalies at once. As such, it becomes
necessary to divide and conquer, in the form of Departments.

Departments are entities within the Foundation that specialize in one specific
task or discipline. They put their expertise to use in areas where others could
not, ensuring that each respective field is given the care and attention it
deserves.

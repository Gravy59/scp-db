All anomalous objects, entities, and phenomena requiring Special Containment
Procedures are assigned an Object Class. Object Classes are for the purposes of
identifying containment needs, research priority, budgeting, and other
considerations. An SCP's Object Class is determined by a number of factors, but
the most important factors are the difficulty and the purpose of its
containment.

## Primary Classes

These are the most common Object Classes used in SCP files, and make up the bulk
of the objects.

### Safe

Safe-class SCPs are anomalies that are easily and safely contained. This is
often due to the fact that the Foundation has researched the SCP well enough
that containment does not require significant resources or that the anomalies
require a specific and conscious activation or trigger. Classifying an SCP as
Safe, however, does not mean that handling or activating it does not pose a
threat.

### Euclid

Euclid-class SCPs are anomalies that require more resources to contain
completely or where containment isn't always reliable. Usually this is because
the SCP is insufficiently understood or inherently unpredictable. Euclid is the
Object Class with the greatest scope, and it's usually a safe bet that an SCP
will be this class if it doesn't easily fall into any of the other standard
Object Classes.

As a note, any SCP that's autonomous, sentient and/or sapient is generally
classified as Euclid, due to the inherent unpredictability of an object that can
act or think on its own.

### Keter

Keter-class SCPs are anomalies that are exceedingly difficult to contain
consistently or reliably, with containment procedures often being extensive and
complex. The Foundation often can't contain these SCPs well due to not having a
solid understanding of the anomaly, or lacking the technology to properly
contain or counter it. A Keter SCP does not mean the SCP is dangerous, just that
it is simply very difficult or costly to contain.

## Secondary Classes

These are less common Object Classes used in SCP files, and make up the a small
number of objects.

### Thaumiel

Thaumiel-class SCPs are anomalies that the Foundation specifically uses to
contain other SCPs. Even the mere existence of Thaumiel-class objects is
classified at the highest levels of the Foundation and their locations,
functions, and current status are known to few Foundation personnel outside of
the O5 Council.

### Neutralized

Neutralized SCPs are anomalies that are no longer anomalous, either through
having been intentionally or accidentally destroyed, or disabled.

### Apollyon

Apollyon-class SCPs are anomalies that cannot be contained, are expected to
breach containment imminently, or some other similar scenario. Such anomalies
are usually associated with world-ending threats or a K-Class Scenario of some
kind and require a massive effort from the Foundation to deal with.

### Archon

Archon-class SCPs are anomalies that could theoretically be contained but are
best left uncontained for some reason. Archon SCPs may be a part of consensus
reality that is difficult to fully contain or may have adverse effects if put
into containment. These SCPs are not uncontainableâ€”the defining feature of the
class is that the Foundation chooses to not put the anomaly into containment.

## Non-Standard Object Classes

The following Object Classes are sub-classes that supplement the object's
primary (or former) classification.

### Explained

Explained SCPs are commonly files about anomalies that are completely and fully
understood to the point where their effects are now explainable by mainstream
science or phenomena that have been debunked or falsely mistaken as an anomaly.

### Esoteric/Narrative Classes

Esoteric Object Classes, also occasionally referred to as Narrative classes, are
Object classes that do not fall into any of the above sections. They are
generally only used once and are created to further the narrative in a
particular SCP. It is highly recommended that SCPs use one of the standard
Object Classes listed here.

## The Locked Box Test

The Locked Box Test is an informal guideline used to determine an object's most
appropriate Object Class. It goes like this:

- If you lock it in a box, leave it alone, and nothing bad will happen, then
  it's probably Safe.
- If you lock it in a box, leave it alone, and you're not entirely sure what
  will happen, then it's probably Euclid.
- If you lock it in a box, leave it alone, and it easily escapes, then it's
  probably Keter.
- If it is the box, then it's probably Thaumiel.
- If you can't fit it in a box and it's about to end the world, then it's
  probably Apollyon.
- If you could have locked it in a box but chose not to, then it's probably
  Archon.

Note that as a special consideration, something that is autonomous, alive,
and/or sapient is almost always at least Euclid-class. That is, if you lock a
living thing in a box and forget about it, it will eventually suffocate or
starve to death, and that's not a good outcome. Something that is intelligent
could also end up being smart enough to outwit its containment procedures and/or
stop cooperating with the Foundation's attempts to contain it, making it more
dangerous than it otherwise might be.

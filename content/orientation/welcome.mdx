Welcome to the SCP Foundation, Dr. Wineland.

It has likely been a difficult journey to find yourself where
you are today, having to be scouted out by people you've
never met before and invited to exams and interviews for a
position you were never fully told of. We can imagine you
already have a few questions, whether it be where you are, who
is here with you, or why you were chosen to be here. Many of
these questions we will not be able to answer.

In the interest of not making new researchers go through their
first several weeks guessing what each task force, site, and
acronym actually stands for, I have compiled all the information
you'd reasonably need (and can be given) into a single
message, sent to every new researcher's personal inbox. We
recommend going over these at your earliest convenience.

- [About the SCP Foundation](/orientation/about), our mission statement, a word from the Administrator, and other miscellaneous information we expect new recruits to be aware of.
- [Object Classes](/orientation/object-classes), a rundown of the standard anomaly classification system and what each designation says about its respective item. Required reading for new researchers.
- [Security Clearance Levels](/orientation/clearance-levels), how our classification system works. Violation of clearance levels is grounds for instant contract termination, and likely amnesticization, so take this information to heart.
- [Secure Facilities](/orientation/secure-facilities), an explanation of what your facility's designation stands for, along with what to expect in such locations.
- [Research Departments](/orientation/research-departments). Due to the vast amount of anomalous items in our possession, we have multiple operational departments, each focusing on a different aspect of our research. Cursory knowledge of these sectors may assist you when handling unknown objects.
- [The Task Forces](/orientation/task-forces), our highly specialized containment teams. Depending on the anomaly you may require a different kind of expertise than what you personally know, so a cursory knowledge of this list may help during times of crisis. A more complete MTF list can be viewed if you possess the appropriate clearance levels.
- [K-Class Scenarios](/orientation/k-class), as a reminder of what horrors lurk in the dark.

If you have any more questions, ask your assigned senior
researcher. Remember: there’s a considerable likelihood that
your question will have a classified answer. You may not receive
a response.

Welcome again, recruit, and good luck.

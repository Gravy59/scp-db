K-Class Scenarios are hypothetical situations that could have drastic effects on
normality or reality, including the end of the world. The Foundation plans how
to manage events in these scenarios to minimize casualties.

## CK-class "Reality Restructuring" Scenario

Reality is changed by a deity/reality bender/retrocausal altering of
history/etc. These can be radical, broad changes representing a true end of the
world, or small "localized" changes.

## NK-Class "Grey Goo" Scenario

Named for a hypothetical scenario where self-replicating nano-machines
malfunction and turn the whole world into goop. This is often used for
self-replicating SCPs which could cause extensive contamination to the planet.

## SK-Class "Dominance Shift" Scenario

Another species or civilization surpasses humanity as dominant species, or vice
versa.

## XK-Class "End of the World" Scenario

Most common and broadest meaning, covers just about any apocalypse. Religious
apocalypse, humanity destroyed, Earth destroyed, the universe destroyed, etc.

## ZK-Class Reality Failure Scenario

Reality is fundamentally broken or eliminated. Usually due to physics or an SCP
that annihilates things by nature.

May also happen in a limited "localized" area.
